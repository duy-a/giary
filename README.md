## Very opinionated system for a to-do app
1. Write down long term goal (good practice to run a goal through S.M.A.R.T. criteria)
2. At the start of the week: write down up to 3 most important tasks for the week, making sure it is aligned with the long term goal
3. At the start of the day: write down only 1 most important task of the day + up to 3 additional tasks (if required), making sure they are aligned with the weekâ€™s tasks
4. During the day reference the tasks & write notes (if necessary)
5. At the end of the day: review completed and not completed tasks. For not completed tasks indicate to remove the task or reschedule to another day.
6. Repeat Step 3 - 5 till the end of the week 
7. At the end of the week: review completed and not completed tasks. For not completed tasks indicate to remove the task or reschedule to another week.
8. Repeat Step 2 - 7 till the goal is achieved
9. ???
10. Profit
